Thanks for visiting! I'm Yinmu, a Software Developer, a Langauge Teacher and Mum to a cheeky kitty baby called Mochi. Would you like a cuppa coffee? ☕

I have been working as a teacher for a few years before becoming a Software Developer, thanks to the Pandemic in 2020/2021 when I explored and used a wide range of EdTech to engage students online. I soon discovered that I would love to build something - something interesting, helpful and can make complex processes faster, easier and more convenient.

I then learned how to code, and still learning more toolings to develop better applications. I am so happy that I find something I enjoy doing, and I cannot wait to build things together!👩🏻‍💻

Oh, by the way, Mochi is here. See if you can catch him 😉.
